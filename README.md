# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Fraud-Detection-and-Prediction-in-Credit-Card-Applications
Creating a hybrid deep learning model using Self Organizing maps and Artificial Neural Networks for feature detection (SOM) and prediction (ANN) for a data of credit card applications


## About the Files in this Project

- Credit_Card_Applications.csv : The Dataset file in csv (comma separated values) format

- minisom.py : Class used for creating the self organizing map , https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom

- Hybrid Deep Learning.py : Main python file containing the project code

 
## Dataset Information :


This file concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. 

This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values. There are also a few missing values.
